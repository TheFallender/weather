## Weather API

This site uses the API from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) to get the list of possible locations and [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) to resolve the location to get the weather info. You need to have to get your own api keys for both the sites, those will be saved in the application storage so you don't have to reenter those.

To launch it, you have to:
1. Donwload the release.
2. Extract the release on a folder of your preference.
3. Open the folder and run `yarn start` to run the code.
4. A tab will open on your browser pointing to: [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

If you do not want to go through this process. You can see a working version on:
[~~thefallender.github.io/weather~~](https://thefallender.github.io/weather) Site is offline now, you can still build it on local.
